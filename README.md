# ECS 152A Programming Project 3 (Fall 2025)

This project is meant to teach TCP congestion control algorithms through implementation. You will build sender programs that transfer files over an emulated network with variable bandwidth, latency, and packet loss.

## Quick Start

1. **Setup** (one time): Install Docker - see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
2. **Testing**: Use the simplified test script (optionally pass a custom payload):
   ```bash
   cd docker
   ./test_sender.sh your_sender.py [payload.zip]
   ```
3. **Troubleshooting**: Having issues? Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### Quick Test Workflow

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
cd docker

# Build + launch simulator (detached, keeps running)
./start-simulator.sh

# Test your implementation (optional payload arg)
./test_sender.sh my_stop_and_wait.py [payload.zip]
```

**Windows (Command Prompt/Batch):**

```batch
cd docker

# Build + launch simulator (detached, keeps running)
start_sim.bat

# Test your implementation (optional payload arg)
test_sender.bat my_stop_and_wait.py [payload.zip]
```

**What the test scripts are supposed to do:**

- ✓ Verify Docker/daemon status
- ✓ Ensure the long-running simulator container is up
- ✓ Copy your sender and the chosen payload into `/app` and `/hdd`
- ✓ Start a fresh in-container receiver for every run (instead of restarting the container)
- ✓ Run your sender, collect metrics, and print CSV + averages

### Payload files 101

- **Default file**: Every script uses `file.zip` (from `docker/` or `docker/hdd/`) when you omit the third argument.
- **Custom file**: Pass any relative or absolute path (`./test_sender.sh my_sender.py assets/mytrace.zip`). The script copies it into `/hdd/` inside the container with the same basename.
- **Receivers**: The test harness sets `PAYLOAD_FILE`/`TEST_FILE` env vars before starting in-container receivers. The stock `receiver.py` and the provided Python sender templates consume these to find both the source file (`/hdd/<name>`) and the output (`/hdd/<name>_received.*`).

### Skeleton sender for smoke testing

Need to verify Docker, the simulator, and the receiver are all behaving before you start coding? Use the baked-in skeleton:

```bash
cd docker
./test_sender.sh sender_skeleton.py [payload.zip]
```

It sends two quick demo packets (plus the EOF marker) and prints metrics so you can confirm the end-to-end flow. Feel free to copy `docker/sender_skeleton.py` as a starting point for your own sender; it already demonstrates:

- how to read `PAYLOAD_FILE` / `TEST_FILE` from the environment
- how to format packets (`SEQ_ID` + payload) and parse ACK/FIN responses
- how to emit the CSV metrics line that the grading scripts expect

## What You'll Implement

Four congestion control algorithms:

1. **Stop-and-Wait** - Send one packet, wait for ACK (simplest)
2. **Sliding Window** - Send multiple packets up to a window size, wait for ACKs
3. **TCP Tahoe** - Slow start + congestion avoidance + fast retransmit
4. **TCP Reno** - Adds fast recovery to Tahoe for better performance
5. **Custom Protocol** - Design your own congestion control algorithm to beat TCP Reno

## Network Simulation

The shipping `training_profile.sh` drives a 5-phase traffic pattern by reshaping the loopback interface with `tc`. Each phase lasts 20–40 seconds before randomly switching, so you should expect long stretches of bufferbloat punctuated by shorter recovery periods.

| Phase | Scenario (from `training_profile.sh`)            | Bandwidth (kbps) | Base Delay (ms) | Loss (%)   | Queue Limit (packets) |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| 1     | Moderate bottleneck, large queue                 | 1,200 – 2,500    | 60 – 110        | 0.20 – 0.60 | 40,000                |
| 2     | Tight bottleneck, aggressive queuing             | 600 – 1,400      | 80 – 140        | 0.25 – 0.70 | 50,000                |
| 3     | Light congestion / higher capacity               | 2,500 – 4,500    | 40 – 80         | 0.30 – 1.10 | 25,000                |
| 4     | Moderate capacity                                | 3,500 – 6,000    | 30 – 70         | 0.25 – 0.85 | 20,000                |
| 5     | Sudden squeeze to force instant queue build-up   | 800 – 1,400      | 70 – 120        | 0.20 – 0.70 | 45,000                |

All phases run over the `lo` interface, so you still test locally, but the HTB + netem stack enforces the above limits.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **You are NOT supposed to make changes to any file in this repository except your own sender implementations.**

Files you should NOT modify:

- `receiver.py` - Pre-built receiver
- `training_profile.sh` - Network emulation configuration
- `docker-script.sh` - Container startup logic
- `Dockerfile` - Container setup
